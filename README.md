# üê¶ Twitter Keyword Sentiment Analysis & Visualization

This project enables users to scrape and analyze tweets based on specific keywords or hashtags using Python. It uses `snscrape`, a powerful scraping library that avoids the limitations of the Twitter API (no authentication required), and performs basic but insightful analysis on the gathered tweet data.

## üîç Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Collect tweets related to any topic or keyword
- Clean and process the tweet data
- Visualize common terms using word clouds
- Identify the most active users and languages for a keyword
- Export the final dataset to CSV for further use

It's designed as a beginner-friendly tool for learning data scraping, analysis, and visualization in Python.
